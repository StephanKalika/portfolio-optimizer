# Architecture Roadmap

This document outlines the planned architectural improvements for the Portfolio Optimizer system.

## Current Architecture

The Portfolio Optimizer system currently uses a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **API Gateway Service**: Routes requests to appropriate backend services
2. **Data Ingestion Service**: Fetches and stores historical stock data
3. **Model Training Service**: Trains and manages ML models
4. **Portfolio Optimization Service**: Optimizes portfolio weights
5. **Frontend Service**: Provides the user interface
6. **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores stock data and other information
7. **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring

All backend services are standardized on FastAPI for improved performance, built-in API documentation, and async support.

## Short-term Improvements (1-3 months)

### 1. Message Queue Integration

Implement a message queue (RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka) for:

- Asynchronous processing of long-running tasks (e.g., model training)
- Decoupling services for better fault tolerance
- Event-driven architecture patterns

```
[Frontend] -> [API Gateway] -> [Service] -> [Message Queue] -> [Worker]
```

### 2. Distributed Tracing

- Implement OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- Add request IDs for cross-service request tracking
- Enhance logging with structured formats and correlation IDs

### 3. Enhanced Caching

- Implement Redis for caching common API responses
- Cache model predictions for repeated queries
- Use caching for frequently accessed reference data

## Medium-term Improvements (3-6 months)

### 1. Service Mesh Implementation

- Deploy Istio or Linkerd as a service mesh
- Implement advanced traffic management
- Enhanced observability and security

### 2. API Gateway Enhancements

- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request validation and transformation
- API versioning support

### 3. Database Optimizations

- Implement read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Database sharding strategy for horizontal scaling
- Consider time-series database for historical price data

### 4. Containerization Improvements

- Define resource limits for containers
- Implement container health checks
- Set up container monitoring
- Container orchestration with Docker Compose
- Use Docker Compose profiles for different deployment scenarios

## Long-term Vision (6+ months)

### 1. Multi-model Training Infrastructure

- Build a scalable infrastructure for training multiple models in parallel
- GPU support for faster model training
- Model A/B testing framework

### 2. Real-time Data Processing

- Implement streaming data processing for real-time market data
- Real-time portfolio rebalancing recommendations
- Streaming analytics pipeline

### 3. Advanced ML Model Management

- Model versioning and lifecycle management
- Automated retraining based on model drift detection
- Model explainability tools

### 4. Multi-region Deployment

- Deploy services across multiple geographic regions
- Implement global load balancing
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Technical Debt Reduction

### 1. Code Quality

- Increase test coverage (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests)
- Implement consistent coding standards
- Add comprehensive API documentation

### 2. Dependency Management

- Regular updates of dependencies
- Vulnerability scanning
- Dependency isolation

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring dashboards with Prometheus and Grafana
- ✅ System-wide health monitoring
- ✅ Service-level metrics and instrumentation
- ✅ Consistent service naming across monitoring components
- ✅ Detailed service status panels with endpoint-specific metrics
- Alert definitions for critical service metrics
- Automated incident response
- SLO/SLI implementation and tracking
- Custom dashboard for ML model performance metrics

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Improvement | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Message Queue Integration | High | Medium | 1 |
| Distributed Tracing | Medium | Low | 2 |
| Caching | Medium | Low | 3 |
| Service Mesh | High | High | 4 |
| Multi-model Training | High | High | 5 |
| Real-time Processing | Medium | High | 6 |
